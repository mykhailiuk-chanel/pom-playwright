# Installation: Page Object Model (POM) + Playwright 

Welcome to the Page Object Model (POM) + Playwright boilerplate project! This repository provides a solid foundation for building efficient and maintainable automated tests using the POM design pattern combined with Playwright, a powerful browser automation library.
_(instead of installing it from NPM it is recommended to clone it from repo instead)_

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mykhailiuk-chanel/pom-playwright.git

```

Step 2: Install dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm i
```

This will install cypress & cucmber deps

Step 3: Run tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You can add an extra configuration to the playwright.config.js if needed.
